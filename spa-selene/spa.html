                        <p class="feature-desc">The intention behind the build for Spa Selene was to apply front end patterns I had been learning in JavaScript and implement them together to form a full site. This process allowed me to gain greater confidence problem solving with JavaScript and continue flexing my CSS layosut muscles. Due to the nature of the buisness the website was chosen to reflex, there were some essential features I knew had to be incorported. First, the website needed to feature a menu component and display related content filtered by category. Also, a form validation component was necessary to facilitate the exchange of customer information to reserve a service. In my mind, these two features formed the primary development goals for the site with more general  components like an about section, a frequently asked questions section, and a reviews section emplyed to add legitamecy and well rounded aspects to better inform the site's purpose to users.

                    There were a number of javascript patterns I knew would be compatible components for this application. I was confident in a number of the these features due to prior study and mini-projects I've worked through and completed. Namely:
                    - the responsive and fixed navigation
                    - displaying a category of data in response to a click event
                    - the accordion component
                    - the reviews component
            
                    Two specific patterns I knew needed to be implemented but was less clear on how to accomplish was the <span>multistep form validation</span> and <span>its integration with the navigation bar to generate a popup in response to a click</span>.
            
                    For the form validation, it took far more trial and error.
            
            
                    A feature I didn't initially expect to run into issues with but later became incorporated significantly into the UI of my site was with background images. I ended up doing a fair share of reading documentation and fiddling to make sure that the background images would remain in a location that made sense and didn't hinder the readability of any information during resize from mobile to desktop. This taught me alot about background images I didn't previously have exposure to.
                    Javascript patterns practiced
                    - navigation scroll heights
                    - fetching a category of data in response to a click event
                    - multi-step form validation
                    CSS
                    - fun mouse hover animations behind the cards

                <h2 class="feature-heading2">Project Backstory</h2>
                <p class="feature-desc">The idea to design a site for a theoretical spa came after I had issues booking a massage service for my partner's birthday. The experience I had using a local buisnesses' site was seriously lacking. For starters, the overall website has UI that appeared to not have been updated since the early days of the internet. Additionally, the online booking form didn't allow me to hit the next button after filling out all correct information. It was borderline unusable. To solve this problem I had the idea to redesign the site and offer my completed work to the buisness for free. After discussion, the buisness was grateful for the interest I took in improving their online presence and made a note of my suggestions for a future overhall of their site. The experience I gained from the process of this project build was invaluable.</p>

                <p class="feature-desc">
                    For any project I build from scratch, I start by creating quick sketches of my vision for the UI and annotate it with my ideas for the functionality. This helps the design process go much faster and smoother as I can easily throw out a 1-minute sketch and draft another as opposed to wasting time coding something up I then decide isn't appealing. This also really helps me for planning purposes so I can get a big picture of the application and then move forward in identifing things I know I can tackle quickly as opposed to things I want to accomplish but don't have as much experience implementing. After the planning stage, I coded up my HTML markup with the bones of the design and identified color and font themes to start constructing my SASS variables. As I progressed through the build of the layout, I primarily utilized CSS grid.</p><br>
                    
                    <p class="feature-desc">In the project description, I mentioned there were a number of javascript patterns I knew would be compatible components for this application. I was confident in a number of the these elements due to prior study and mini-projects I've worked through and completed. These features namely being:</p><br>
                    <ul class="feature-sub-list">
                        <li>the responsive and fixed navigation</li>
                        <li>the accordion component</li>
                        <li>the reviews component</li>
                        <li>and process of displaying a category of data in response to a click event</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <p class="feature-desc">
                    As a result, I was able to build all of the above features for the site in four days. It would have happened much faster but I wanted to explore how to make the UI for these items more interesting. This involved my time spent learning how to effectively manipulate background images, animate items in on scroll, and add a mouse hover effect from behind the menu cards. The learning process I followed for all unknown functionality I wanted to implement in the project involved a combination of reading documentation on Mozilla Developer Network, reviewing existing code (via StackOverflow, CodePen, Github), reading tutorials on CSS tricks, and watching youtube video tutorials. Once I was confident in how the code worked, I would build the feature in a seperate standalone file to make sure I understood what I learned and could trouble shoot more easily. Then, I would build the new feature into the main project. </p><br>

                    <p class="feature-desc">Two specific patterns I knew needed to be implemented but was less clear on how to accomplish was the
                    multistep form validation and its integration with the navigation bar to generate a popup in response to a click. I had completed single step form validation multiple times at this point, so I was excited for the challenge. I watched youtube tutorials and reviewed several codepen's in preparation. I came to find the difficult part was finding a build that was written in vanilla javascript that applied unique validation functions for input and select elements. I ended up compiling different aspects from this learning phase combined with refactoring sessions to achieve the validation I wanted for this multistep form functionality.

                    The brunt of this functionalities work takes place in the nextSteps() function. Here all of the inputs 

 

                    The validation functions needed to communicate an error or success. Then the collection of elements on the active form step are checked to see if they all were successful or an error returned. A nested if statement on the element then checks to see if all the conditions are met: if the item was required, if the associated form step is active, and then if all

                    First, I only wanted certain elements to be required in addition to certain elements only being displayed if a corresponding option was checked. It was important to only run functions to validate elements on a specific step. And these functions had to communicate an error or success on the element that would used for styling but also as a check to determine if the user could move on to the next step in the form. 





                    It was critial for the functions tied to certain inputs to only run during the matching step or phase of the form validation. To do this I created a function that would apply a class of "active" to a given form step/phase based on its order in the HTML. Once that was set up I needed to set up variables for cases for weather a given element was required by the form, if when the function run it returned a success or error, and if the user wants to go to the next or previous step in the form.

It makes it possible for both parties to easily accomplish their primary objectives when interacting with the site. With the objectives for the buisness being to schedule more clients for appoitments, and the customer being able to browse and reserve servicesa at their leisure. In the future, I want to continue learning and developing strategies like this that make online applications more seamless for people to accomplish their goals.</p>
