## Overview

## The goal

The goal for this portfolio was to produce a site with a clean UI to displays key projects that reflect my experience and competency with front end patterns.

- Browse through a list of specified projects
- Read descriptions about each project
- Visit the Live Project hosted on Github
- Download my resume

- View the optimal layout for a component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
